Second chance loans are often offered by lenders that specialize in the subprime market. Like many other subprime loans, a second chance loan may have a typical term-to-maturity (such as a 30-year mortgage), but it is usually meant to be used as a short-term financing vehicle. Borrowers can obtain money now and – by making regular, on-time payments – begin to repair their credit history. At that point, they may be able to obtain a new loan with more favorable terms, allowing them to pay off the second chance loan. The high interest rate on a second chance loan gives borrowers an incentive to refinance as soon as they are able to.
