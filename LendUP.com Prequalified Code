What Is a Second Chance Loan?

A second chance loan is a type of loan intended for borrowers with a poor credit history, who would most likely be unable to qualify for traditional financing. As such, it is considered a form of subprime lending. A second chance loan generally charges a significantly higher interest rate than would be available to borrowers who are considered less of a credit risk.
